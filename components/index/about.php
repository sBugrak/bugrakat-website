    <p>I'm <?php echo floor(num: date(format: 'Y') - 2001.5); ?> and I'm currently a student in <a class="about-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.erciyes.edu.tr/">Erciyes University</a>.</p>
    <p>The reason why I'm making this website is to help my girlfriend <strong class="about-strong">Kat üíù</strong> to track her habits. I also want to use this as an opportunity to learn web development and track my habits like learning Swedish properly!</p>

        <h2>Development Diary</h2>
        <p><strong class="about-strong">Week 1:</strong> I've been trying to find a way to develop a website. I had in mind that a lot of people were saying that the best method is the old school/simple one. So I started with as simplistic as it gets, basic HTML and CSS. I'm not writing javascript since I want the website to work with any device. This week, I picked a color palette and worked on the design of the website. I will keep the design eye-friendly and simple. There's no shiny or bright colors, and that is deliberate. I want the user to focus on the task they are doing instead of getting distracted by unnecessary things.</p>
